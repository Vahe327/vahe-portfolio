## 💡 **About Me**

I design and deploy complete blockchain ecosystems — from custom L1 chains with mining pools to cross-chain DEXs and wallet tools.  
I’m deeply interested in DeFi security, efficient routing, smart contract traps and creating user-friendly financial applications.  
I love to build fast, learn fast and deliver robust tools that push the boundaries of decentralized finance.
